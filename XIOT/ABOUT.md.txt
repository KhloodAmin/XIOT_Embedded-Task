Through my code I tried to accomplish the task so my code begin with the Main functions where i begin to Set 
1- Timer 
2- GPIO
3- ADC 

First thing I do is to control the led state depending on the switch then I added the Sensor Part. 
I used the timer interrupt to calculate the rate specified.

For Serial i connect Virtual Terminal to UART pins and send the data to it through Print Function which calles every 3 seconds to calculate Temperature and send it
yo serial 

I have a problem the the 2 interrupts are conflicted so i define " Enter_Critical_Section_Area " in the beginning of each interrupt 
which disable ell interrupts untill this interrupt is done and "Exit_Critical_Section_Area " to resume the Code
